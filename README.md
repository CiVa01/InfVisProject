**Domain selection**

The users and decision makers of our web-based visualization tool are people who need insights into migration patterns between municipalities. This could be the (local) government for making decisions about housing policies, or starters, looking to identify where housing is accessible.

If you are moving from a big city, you might be interested where your peers are moving to, and this visualisation allows you to see that.

**Data**

We used the dataset "tussen gemeente verhuisde personen" from the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics: https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/81734NED/table?ts=1733910455691

**Code**

All code in this document is written by us. For the visualisations we made extensive use of the d3 library. 

**Running the code**

In order to run the code, download the repository and open index.html in the browser. No further action should be required.
