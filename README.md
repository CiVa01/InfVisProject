**Domain selection**

The users and decision makers of our web-based visualization tool are people who need insights into migration patterns between municipalities. This could be the (local) government for making decisions about housing policies.

**Data wrangling** _The data should be cleaned as much as possible after this point. Upload your data wrangling code as part of your code submission._

We used the dataset "tussen gemeente verhuisde personen" from the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics: https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/81734NED/table?ts=1733910455691

**Data understanding** _Understand your data and its complexity. Upload screenshots._

**Sketches** _Each team member should create at least three visualization sketch alternatives for one of the data aspects. Upload photos of sketches._

**Interface design** _Submit also a photo of your interface with interaction specifications, depicting the planned website design._
